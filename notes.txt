edits to the game
- change square into something else
(possibly for implementation of the carnitaur)
-connect animation of carnitaur to the object tied to the "square's" actions
- so, would have to create an object for the carnitaur animation
	(store carnitaur animation somewhere)
- probably add event listeners for "game start"
	(when player starts game carnitaur starts running)
	(different animation for dino jump)
	(need to tie to keystrokes)
	(keyup and keydown stuff)
